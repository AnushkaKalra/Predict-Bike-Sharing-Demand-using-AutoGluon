# Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-using-AutoGluon
Udacity AWS ML Fundamentals Project 1

Submission Date: May 12, 2024

## üåç **Project Overview**
Bike-sharing systems have become a popular mode of urban transportation, and accurately predicting daily bike-sharing demand is critical for optimizing operations and resource allocation. This project leverages **Amazon's AutoGluon framework** to build a robust predictive model, automating key machine-learning tasks to achieve high accuracy with minimal manual intervention.

## üöÄ **Features**
- Automated machine learning (AutoML) with AutoGluon for streamlined model selection and tuning.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure clean and relevant inputs.
- Evaluation of model performance using key metrics, including RMSE and leaderboard scoring on Kaggle.
- Insights into feature importance and their impact on predictions.

## üß† **Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and transforming features for better predictive power.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified trends and relationships between features and the target variable using visualizations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features to improve model performance, leading to significant error reduction.
4. **Model Development**: Leveraged AutoGluon to train multiple models and select the best-performing one based on RMSLE.
5. **Evaluation and Submission**: Predicted results were submitted to Kaggle for scoring, achieving a **private leaderboard score of 0.51219**.

---

## üìä **Results**
- **Model Performance**: Achieved a Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) of **0.51219** on Kaggle's leaderboard.
- **Error Reduction**: Improved the model significantly through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, reducing the error from **1.80478 to 0.63013**.
- **Automation**: Successfully automated the machine learning workflow using AutoGluon, making the pipeline scalable and reusable.
